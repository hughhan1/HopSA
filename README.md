# HopSA

HopSA allows users to find the hottest events going on around them, created by other users of the platform. 

This was an app that was built using the [MEAN stack](http://mean.io/#!/). It was started at the Fall 2015 [HopHacks](https://hophacks.com) at Johns Hopkins University.

### Updates ###

HopSA has been renamed to DashTo.

This version of the project is no longer being built. We've come a long way since then, and the new version of the product (currently in beta) is being built for iOS, and can be viewed here: http://facebook.com/dashtoapp.

The new codebase is currently private, but we have decided to keep this repository public and the original app live (viewable [here](http://hopkinspsatest.herokuapp.com)) for memories sake.
